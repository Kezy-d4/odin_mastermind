THE TASK (PHASE 1)
Build a Mastermind game from the command line where you have 10 turns to guess
the secret code, starting with you guessing the computerâ€™s random code.
Build the game assuming the computer randomly selects the secret numbers and 
the human player must guess them. Remember that you need to give the proper 
feedback on how good the guess was each turn!

THE PLAN (PHASE 1)
  - Have the computer randomly select its 4 number code from a selection of 
    6 numbers, allowing any amount of duplicate numbers, but not any blanks. 

  - Have the player input their guess so that the computer can respond with the 
    appropriate feedback; that is, a red peg for each present number in the 
    correct position, a white peg for each present number in the wrong position, 
    and no peg for each number not present in the code.

  - Repeat the previous step until the player has correctly guessed the code or
    has exhausted their 10 available guesses.

  - Announce the winner. If the player is not able to guess the code, 
    the computer wins. If the player is able to guess the code, they win, 
    so announce the number of turns it took for them to get guess the code.
